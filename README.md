## MIST

This repository contains the source code and benchmark instances of the AAAI'21 paper **Choosing the Initial State for Online Replanning** by Maximilian Fickert, Ivan Gavran, Ivan Fedotov, JÃ¶rg Hoffmann, Rupak Majumdar, and Wheeler Ruml.

Most of the MIST code is implemented in `src/search/online`. The MIST search engine is declared as `online_pruning`, the recoverability variant is called `online_recoverability`. For example, the best-performing MIST configuration of the evaluation in the paper is invoked with:

```
./fast-downward.py <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl> --search "online_pruning(ff(), num_reference_nodes=8, moving_average_size=100, reset_expansion_delay=true)"
```

The `benchmarks` directory contains the benchmark set on which we evaluated the algorithms described in the paper. The `split_goals.py` script can be used to split the goals of a standard PPDL instance into multiple sets of goals that appear after a certain amount of time.
